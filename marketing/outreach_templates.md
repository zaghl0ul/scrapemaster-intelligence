Title: I built a tool that alerts you when Amazon products drop in price - looking for beta testers

Hey everyone,

I'm an FBA seller who got tired of manually checking competitor prices. Built a tool that:
- Monitors any product URL 24/7
- Sends instant alerts when prices drop
- Works on Amazon, eBay, Shopify, etc.

Looking for 10 beta users to try it free for a week. If you're interested in:
- Price arbitrage opportunities
- Competitor monitoring
- Never missing deals

Drop a comment or DM me. Already helping 3 sellers make $500+ per week from alerts.

Subject: Found 3 products you're selling that are overpriced

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're selling [Product] on Amazon for $X.

Your competitor [Competitor] just dropped their price to $Y (20% lower).

I built a tool that automatically monitors your competitors and alerts you to:
- Price changes
- Stock levels
- New listings

Would you be interested in a 5-minute demo? My current users are averaging $2k/month in additional profit from the insights.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's a free report showing your top 5 competitors' current prices: [link]

ðŸš¨ Amazon Sellers: Stop Losing Money to Price Changes!

Just helped a client find $3,200 in profit opportunities last month by monitoring competitor prices.

If you're:
âœ… An FBA seller
âœ… Tired of manual price checking
âœ… Want instant alerts when competitors drop prices

I've got 5 spots open for new users at $99/month (normally $199).

Comment "ALERT" and I'll DM you details.

(Admins: Happy to remove if not allowed, just trying to help fellow sellers!)

How I made $1,247 profit last week from a single price alert:

ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡

1/ Set up monitoring on a competitor's gaming headset listing

2/ Got an alert at 2am - price dropped from $89 to $31 (pricing error?)

3/ Bought 40 units immediately

4/ Resold at $79 each over the next 5 days

5/ Profit: $1,920 - $673 (Amazon fees) = $1,247

Want these alerts? I built a tool that monitors ANY product URL.

First 10 people get it for $99/month (50% off): [your-link]

Subject: Your competitor [Competitor Name] just dropped prices by 30%

Hi [Name],

[Competitor] just reduced prices on 15 products you both sell. 

You're now overpriced on:
- [Product 1]: You: $X, Them: $Y
- [Product 2]: You: $X, Them: $Y
- [Product 3]: You: $X, Them: $Y

I help e-commerce stores monitor competitor pricing automatically.

Interested in staying competitive without manual checking?

P.S. I can show you 3 more competitors you're not tracking yet.
