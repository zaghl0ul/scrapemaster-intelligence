Subject: Losing sales to competitor price changes? (5-min fix)

Hi {{firstName}},

Noticed {{company}} operates in {{industry}}. Quick question:

How often do you manually check competitor pricing?

Most e-commerce businesses lose 15-20% of potential sales because they're unaware when competitors adjust their pricing strategies.
