# Lean Deployment Guide - Start Making Money in 24 Hours

## Day 1: Get It Running (2-4 hours)

### 1. Quick Server Setup
```bash
# Use Railway.app (easier than Heroku)
# 1. Create account at railway.app
# 2. Connect GitHub repo
# 3. Add these environment variables:
SECRET_KEY=any-random-string-here
USE_PROXIES=false  # Start without proxies
```

### 2. Minimal Configuration
Create `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "streamlit run src/app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Deploy
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

## Day 2-3: Get First Paying Client

### 1. Target Market (Pick ONE)
```
A. Amazon Sellers ($299/mo)
   - Find them: Facebook groups, r/FulfillmentByAmazon
   - Pitch: "Track competitor prices automatically"
   
B. Sneaker Resellers ($199/mo)
   - Find them: Discord servers, Twitter
   - Pitch: "Never miss a drop - instant alerts"
   
C. E-commerce Stores ($399/mo)
   - Find them: Shopify forums
   - Pitch: "Monitor competitor inventory & pricing"
```

### 2. Simple Sales Script
```
"Hi [Name], I noticed you sell [products]. 

I built a tool that automatically monitors your competitors' prices and inventory 24/7 and alerts you to changes.

For example, if your competitor drops their price or runs out of stock, you'll know within minutes.

I'm offering early access for just $199/month (normally $399). 

Interested in a quick demo?"
```

### 3. Close the Deal
- Use Stripe Payment Links (no code needed)
- Create recurring subscription
- Start monitoring their targets immediately

## Day 4-7: Scale to $1000 MRR

### 1. Add ScraperAPI ($29/mo)
```python
# In .env
SCRAPERAPI_KEY=your-key-here

# Simple integration
def scrape_with_scraperapi(url):
    api_url = f"http://api.scraperapi.com?api_key={API_KEY}&url={url}"
    return requests.get(api_url)
```

### 2. Basic Email Alerts
```python
# Use SendGrid free tier (100 emails/day)
import sendgrid

def send_alert(client_email, changes):
    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key=SENDGRID_KEY)
    
    message = Mail(
        from_email='alerts@yourdomain.com',
        to_emails=client_email,
        subject='Price Change Alert!',
        html_content=f'<strong>{changes}</strong>'
    )
    
    sg.send(message)
```

### 3. Client Acquisition Hacks
- **Reddit**: Help people in r/entrepreneur with scraping questions, mention your service
- **Twitter**: Search "price monitoring" and engage with potential customers
- **Cold Email**: "I noticed your store [specific observation]. Here's how I can help..."
- **Referral Program**: Give clients 1 month free for each referral

## Week 2-4: Scale to $5000 MRR

### 1. Automate Everything
```python
# Auto-onboarding
def create_client_automatically(email, payment_confirmed):
    if payment_confirmed:
        # Create client
        # Send welcome email with login
        # Set up their first target
        # Schedule first scrape
```
